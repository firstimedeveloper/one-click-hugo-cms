You can check out the game from the followingÂ [link](https://2048.junhyukhan.com/). And the github pageÂ [here](https://github.com/firstimedeveloper/2048).

Iâ€™ve been learning to use react and tailwindcss during my free time and decided to recreate the classicÂ [2048](https://play2048.co/)Â game by Gabriele Cirulli (Which Iâ€™m assuming youâ€™re already aware, if somehow you landed onÂ *this*Â post ðŸ˜…).

I have to admit the code itself is pretty bad and the game itself is completely unorginal. However, that doesnâ€™t mean the process of making this game didnâ€™t teach me a few things.

Iâ€™ve seenÂ *a lot*Â of posts and videos telling people to just start coding even though itâ€™ll be really bad. In fact, one quote I really like is

> Writing bad code is a prerequisite to writing good code.\
> â€“Â *someone from the internet*

And prior to this, I would focus (too much) on finding tutorials or guides or blog posts of other people doing something. And although there are some quality tutorials and posts out there, and it seems to make the learning processÂ **much**Â easier, it just doesnâ€™t compare to you actually spending the time to figure it out on your own.
